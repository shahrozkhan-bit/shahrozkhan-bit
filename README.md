## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science graduate with strong foundations in Embedded Systems, C++, Python, and AI model development. I enjoy building practical, performance-optimized systems that solve real-world problems.

I have developed:

- 🔹 Water-Pump Control Unit (Embedded System using C++ & Digital Logic)
- 🔹 Aircraft Propeller Analyzer (Sensor-based RPM & Thrust Analysis System)
- 🔹 Server-Based Plant Disease Detection Application (CNN using TensorFlow/Keras)
- 🔹 etl_api_project (using python/pandas and SQL)

I am highly interested in data-driven systems, backend processing, automation, and scalable architectures.
